I've recently started doing some work on a javascript intensive web application; which called for a more thorough and
maintainable approach to development of the front end js code. One of the most interesting thing's I've come across
is an open source js library called [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/).

Backbone.js is a lightweight MVC framework for javascript; it lets you organise your code more nicely and in turn makes it more maintainable.

Here are the resources I found most useful.
