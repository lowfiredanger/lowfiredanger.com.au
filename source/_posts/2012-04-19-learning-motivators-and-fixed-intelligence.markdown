I've being doing a bit of reading of my partners educational psycology books to help and understand our clients who are in the educational sector. One of the things that resounded with me was the different mindsets that people of any age have about intelligence; changing the mindset and views of itelligence in the individual could dramatically improve their motivation to learn and increase their own intelligence.

Two mindsets
------------
There are two mindsets when it comes to intelligence.

- Intelligence is fixed: People who believe intelligence is fixed, and people who achieve great things are gifted.
- Intelligence can be learnt: People who believe that intelligence can be improved by learning and through experiences.

People who believed that intelligence is fixed and that talent is inherited by luck tended to perform worse academically. This is no suprise since they don't possess the intrisic motivation to improve themselves; they face a challenge and give up or find ways to avoid the challenge. In my view, people who believe intelligence is fixed are also less likely to open up and think or experience new ideas.

In contrast to the people who believe intelligence can be learnt, the people with this mindset tend to be more open and require less extrinsic motivators to learn and try new things. This growth view of intelligence doesn't just help academically, but it could help in other aspects of life, such as social situations, employment etc.

People who possess the growth view of intelligence are less fearful of failing and embrace mistakes, turning these mistakes into lessons to achieve success.

Mindsets in the classroom
------------------------------------
These different mindsets pose some interesting questions when taken into the context of the classroom.

Can educators find out what type of mindsets their students have about intelligence?

Can educators create two different forms of lessons to cater for the two sorts of mindsets?

It's easier to answer this question by thinking about what types of motivation fixed intelligence thinkers require to complete challenges. Extrinsic motivation has been a common form of enticement to get people to complete challenging or mundane tasks.

If an educator can illustrate clearly the value of a particular challenge or task, or offer some form of reward. But this may only reinforce to the student that challenges should only be completed when there is a clear outcome and reward.

How can educators encourage fixed intelligence believers to convert to a growth view of intelligence?
