This will hopefully be a more permanent blog that my team and I can use to write up about interesting things in web application development.

I'll be slowly migrating over the previous blog contents over the next few weeks!

Previous Low Fire Danger blogs reside at the following locations:

- [http://lowfiredanger.heroku.com](http://lowfiredanger.heroku.com)
- [http://lowfiredanger.posterous.com](http://lowfiredanger.posterous.com)

For the curious, we're using [Octopress](http://octopress.org) for our blogging engine.
